/normal interface extends  another normal interface
/*normal interface = more abstract method allowed , not allowed completed(concreate method) method
 *  ParentInterface=1 abstract + ChildInterface=2 = ImplementedClass 3 =abstract method.

Functional Interface:-

 *  ParentFunctionalinteface have => abstract method then ,ChildFunctionalInterface = no more abstract method,if abstract method in ChildFunctionalInterface error

Why error means Functional interface allowed only 1 abstract method and by java functional interface used with lamda expression ,lamda expression handle only one abstract method and other more reason. 
 *  

//if parent  FunctionalInterfaceParent  ,child is normal interface that time child have more abstract method.

//if parent is normal interface, child is Functionalinterface no more abstract method
